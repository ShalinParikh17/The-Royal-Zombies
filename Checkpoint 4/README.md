##Checkpoint 4 - Graph Analytics

In alignment with our groupâ€™s theme to find out what drives an allegation against a police officer to be sustained, our group analyzed the relationships between the police officers in the most predominant categories of allegations. We analyzed the rank of Police officers for our analysis as they are the ones with maximum number of positions in the police department and have the greatest number of allegations and in turn sustained allegations against them. 

To run the aforementioned analysis, run the src/SparkGraphX.ipynb file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook on any browser.
