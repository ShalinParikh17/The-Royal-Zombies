# Checkpoint 2: Visualization

Our group produced visualizations for the following 2 points:
1. Comparison of police officer doppelgangers to understand the relationship between allegations and awards.
2. Do police officers frequently accused of misconduct get rewarded more than their less offending peers? Do factors like whether an allegation is sustained or use of force affect this result?

For each question, we wrote SQL scripts to produce tables, exported the data as csv, and inputted it to D3 to make visualizations.

We link to the D3 Visualization notebooks, where you can see the visualization, the input data, and the code.

`src` contains the SQL scripts to obtain the csv data for each question. 
`data` contains the csv data. 
`images` contains the .png files of the visualizations.
