## Checkpoint 3 - Interactive Visualization

In alignment with our theme to find out the factors affecting the sustainment of
complaints against a given police officer, we have plotted interactive graphs
depicting the difference in sustained and non-sustained complaints given the race,
salary, age, gender and rank of the officer.

● Observable Visualization notebook contains the visualization and the code.

● SQL file contains the SQL queries used to get the data and the csv file
